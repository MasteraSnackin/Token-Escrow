Step 1: Smart Contract Design
Vault Structure
This is the core data structure that holds the details of the token exchange. It will include:

from: The public key of the user sending tokenA.
to: The public key of the user sending tokenB.
tokenA: The public key representing the token type A.
tokenB: The public key representing the token type B.
amountA: The amount of tokenA to be exchanged.
amountB: The amount of tokenB to be exchanged.
fee: The fee to be charged for the transaction.
expiry: The expiration date/time for the contract.
Program Logic
The program will implement the following functions:

create_vault:

Initializes a vault with the necessary details.
This includes setting up the participants (from and to), the token types (tokenA, tokenB), and the amounts (amountA, amountB).
deposit:

Allows both parties to deposit their respective tokens into the vault.
It checks if the deposited amounts are correct and matches what was set during vault creation.
swap:

This function will check if both deposits have been made correctly and if the conditions (like timing) are met.
If everything is correct, it will transfer tokenA to to and tokenB to from.
Deduct the fee before transferring tokens.
withdraw (if necessary):

Allows participants to withdraw their tokens if the contract expires without successful execution.
